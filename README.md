# ToDo-List-App
It’s a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do. 
TODO List are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day to day tasks or list of everything that
we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. 
It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks any time and delete a task which is completed.
